Here, we are implementing ResponseCache that will cache the action method output for the specified time.

It produces the following output and cache that for 10 seconds. 
It will not change before 10 seconds even we refresh the web page again and again internally by clicking Self. 
It means that if we refresh through browser then new Request-Response Cycle generates, 
but within site the ResponseCache caches it for the duration.
