C# FileStream class provides a stream for file operation. 
It can be used to perform synchronous and asynchronous read and write operations. 
By the help of FileStream class, we can easily read and write data into file.
Syntax:
FileStream <object_name> = new FileStream( <file_name>, <FileMode Enumerator>, <FileAccess Enumerator>, <FileShare Enumerator>);
FileMode : can be Append, Create, CreateNew, Open, OpenOrCreate, Truncate.
FileAccess : can be Read, ReadWrite and Write.
FileShare : can be Inheritable, None, Delete, Read, ReadWrite, Write.
